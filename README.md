## General Information
- The project involves building a multiple linear regression model to predict bike-sharing demand in the US, aiming to help BoomBikes prepare for post-pandemic market recovery.
- BoomBikes seeks to understand factors influencing bike demand to enhance their business strategy and recover from revenue dips caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
- The dataset contains daily bike demand information, including various meteorological and usage factors.

## Conclusions
#### Factors significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes are:
#### Annual Trends:
Each additional year correlates with an increase in the demand for bikes, indicating a strong positive trend over time.

#### Humidity and Windspeed: 
Increases in humidity and windspeed are linked to a decrease in bike demand, suggesting that adverse weather conditions negatively affect bike usage.

#### Weather Conditions: 
During high thunderstorms, rain, or snow, bike usage decreases significantly. People tend to avoid biking in adverse weather conditions.

#### Temperature Effects:
Higher temperatures positively impact bike usage, with people more inclined to use bikes as temperatures rise, emphasizing the role of favorable weather.

#### Seasonal Performance: 
Bike usage peaks in September and declines from November to February.

#### Working Days and Mondays: 
There is a notable increase in bike usage on working days, particularly on Mondays, indicating higher demand at the start of the workweek.
